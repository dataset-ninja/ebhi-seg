The **EBHI-Seg: Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset for Image Segmentation Tasks** contains 2228 electron microscopic images of histopathological colorectal cancer sections that encompass six tumor differentiation stages: *normal*, *polyp*, *low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia*, *high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia*, *serrated adenoma*, and *adenocarcinoma*. 

Colon cancer is a common deadly malignant tumor, the fourth most common cancer in men, and the third most common cancer in women worldwide. Colon cancer is responsible for 10% of all cancer cases. According to prior research, colon and rectal tumors share many of the same or similar characteristics. Hence, they are often classified collectively. The authors' study categorizes rectal and colon cancers into one colorectal cancer category. Histopathological examination of the intestinal tract is both the gold standard for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a prerequisite for disease treatment.

The intestinal biopsy method, employed to extract a portion of intestinal tissue for histopathological analysis in order to ascertain the patient's true condition, offers the notable advantage of significantly minimizing bodily harm and promoting swift wound healing. Subsequently, the histopathology sample undergoes segmentation and processing with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The application of H&E is a standard technique for staining tissue sections, revealing nuances between the nucleus and cytoplasm and accentuating intricate structures within tissues.

During colon examinations, pathologists initially scrutinize histopathological sections to assess eligibility and pinpoint lesion locations. The pathology sections are subsequently examined and diagnosed using a low-magnification microscope. Should a closer examination be required to observe finer structures, the microscope is adjusted for higher magnification to facilitate further analysis. Nevertheless, the diagnostic process often encounters certain challenges: varying diagnostic outcomes due to subjective interpretations by different physicians, the potential oversight of information amid extensive test data, and the difficulty in effectively analyzing large volumes of previously collected data. Hence, there is a pressing need to address these issues comprehensively.

## Dataset description

The dataset comprises a total of 4,456 histopathology images, featuring 2,228 histopathology section images and an equal number of corresponding ground truth images. These encompass various categories, including _normal_ (76 images and 76 ground truth images), _polyp_ (474 images and 474 ground truth images), _low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_ (639 images and 639 ground truth images), _high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_ (186 images and 186 ground truth images), _serrated adenoma_ (58 images and 58 ground truth images), and _adenocarcinoma_ (795 images and 795 ground truth images).

The dataset's source is the H&E-treated histopathological sections of colon tissues, utilized for assessing image segmentation. Acquired from two histopathologists at the Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, the dataset is meticulously curated by 12 biomedical researchers following specific guidelines. In cases where an image contains a single differentiation stage and the remainder of the image is intact, that differentiation stage is assigned as the image label. If multiple differentiation stages are present, the most conspicuous one is selected as the image label. In general, the image label reflects the most severe and prominent differentiation observed.

The dataset is derived from intestinal biopsies, employing a magnification of 400× for the data slices, with an eyepiece magnification of 10× and an objective magnification of 40×. The imaging process utilizes a Nissan Olympus microscope and NewUsbCamera acquisition software. The image input size is standardized at 224 × 224 pixels, and the file format is *.png.

## Dataset classes description

* **Normal** Colorectal tissue sections of the standard category are made-up of consistently ordered tubular structures and that does not appear infected when viewed under a light microscope.
* **Polyp** Colorectal polyps are similar in shape to the structures in the normal category, but have a completely different histological structure. A polyp is a redundant mass that grows on the surface of the body's cells. Modern medicine usually refers to polyps as unwanted growths on the mucosal surface of the body. The pathological section of the polyp category also has an intact luminal structure with essentially no nuclear division of the cells. Only the atomic mass is slightly higher than that in the normal category.
* **Intraepithelial neoplasia** Intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) is the most critical precancerous lesion. Compared to the normal category, its histological images show increased branching of adenoid structures, dense arrangement, and different luminal sizes and shapes. In terms of cellular morphology, the nuclei are enlarged and vary in size, while nuclear division increases. The standard Padova classification currently classifies intraepithelial neoplasia into low-grade and high-grade INs. High-grade IN demonstrate more pronounced structural changes in the lumen and nuclear enlargement compared to low-grade IN.
* **Adenocarcinoma** Adenocarcinoma is a malignant digestive tract tumor with a very irregular distribution of luminal structures. It is difficult to identify its border structures during observation, and the nuclei are significantly enlarged at this stage.
* **Serrated adenoma** Serrated adenomas are uncommon lesions, accounting for 1% of all colonic polyps. The endoscopic surface appearance of serrated adenomas is not well characterized but is thought to be similar to that of colonic adenomas with tubular or cerebral crypt openings.

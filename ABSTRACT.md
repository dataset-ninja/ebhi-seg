The authors present a novel ***EBHI-Seg: Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset for Image Segmentation Tasks***, which contains 2228 electron microscopic images of histopathological colorectal cancer sections that encompass six tumor differentiation stages: _normal_, _polyp_, _low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_, _high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_, _serrated adenoma_, and _adenocarcinoma_. The segmentation coefficients and evaluation metrics are obtained by segmenting the images of this dataset using different classical machine learning methods and novel deep learning methods. Colon cancer is a common deadly malignant tumor, the fourth most common cancer in men, and the third most common cancer in women worldwide. Colon cancer is responsible for 10% of all cancer cases. According to prior research, colon and rectal tumors share many of the same or similar characteristics. Hence, they are often classified collectively. The authors study categorized rectal and colon cancers into one colorectal cancer category. Histopathological examination of the intestinal tract is both the gold standard for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and a prerequisite for disease treatment.

The advantage of using the intestinal biopsy method to remove a part of the intestinal tissue for histopathological analysis, which is used to determine the true status of the patient, is that it considerably reduces damage to the body and rapid wound healing. The histopathology sample is then sectioned and processed with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Treatment with H&E is a common approach when staining tissue sections to show the inclusions between the nucleus and cytoplasm and highlight the fine structures between tissues. When a pathologist performs an examination of the colon, they first examine the histopathological sections for eligibility and find the location of the lesion. The pathology sections are then examined and diagnosed using a low magnification microscope. If finer structures need to be observed, the microscope is adjusted to use high magnification for further analysis. However, the following problems usually exist in the diagnostic process: the diagnostic results become more subjective and varied due to different doctors reasons; doctors can easily overlook some information in the presence of a large amount of test data; it is difficult to analyze large amounts of previously collected data. Therefore, it is a necessary to address these issues effectively.

## Dataset description

The dataset contained 4,456 histopathology images, including 2,228 histopathology section images and 2,228 ground truth images. These include _normal_ (76 images and 76 ground truth images), _polyp_ (474 images and 474 ground truth images), _low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_ (639 images and 639 ground truth images), _high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia_ (186 images and 186 ground truth images), _serrated adenoma_ (58 images and 58 ground truth images), and _adenocarcinoma_ (795 images and 795 ground truth images). H&E-treated histopathological sections of colon tissues are used as data for evaluating image segmentation. The dataset is obtained from two histopathologists at the Cancer Hospital of China Medical University. It is prepared by 12 biomedical researchers according to the following rules: Firstly, if there is only one differentiation stage in the image and the rest of the image is intact, then the differentiation stage became the image label; Secondly, if there is more than one differentiation stage in the image, then the most obvious differentiation is selected as the image label; In general, the most severe and prominent differentiation in the image was used as the image label. Intestinal biopsy was used as the sampling method in this dataset. The magnification of the data slices is 400×, with an eyepiece magnification of 10× and an objective magnification of 40×. A Nissan Olympus microscope and NewUsbCamera acquisition software are used. The image input size is 224 × 224 pixels, and the format is *.png. 

## Data type description

**Normal** Colorectal tissue sections of the standard category are made-up of consistently ordered tubular structures and that does not appear infected when viewed under a light microscope.
**Polyp** Colorectal polyps are similar in shape to the structures in the normal category, but have a completely different histological structure. A polyp is a redundant mass that grows on the surface of the body's cells. Modern medicine usually refers to polyps as unwanted growths on the mucosal surface of the body. The pathological section of the polyp category also has an intact luminal structure with essentially no nuclear division of the cells. Only the atomic mass is slightly higher than that in the normal category.
**Intraepithelial neoplasia** Intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) is the most critical precancerous lesion. Compared to the normal category, its histological images show increased branching of adenoid structures, dense arrangement, and different luminal sizes and shapes. In terms of cellular morphology, the nuclei are enlarged and vary in size, while nuclear division increases. The standard Padova classification currently classifies intraepithelial neoplasia into low-grade and high-grade INs. High-grade IN demonstrate more pronounced structural changes in the lumen and nuclear enlargement compared to low-grade IN.
**Adenocarcinoma** Adenocarcinoma is a malignant digestive tract tumor with a very irregular distribution of luminal structures. It is difficult to identify its border structures during observation, and the nuclei are significantly enlarged at this stage.
**Serrated adenoma** Serrated adenomas are uncommon lesions, accounting for 1% of all colonic polyps. The endoscopic surface appearance of serrated adenomas is not well characterized but is thought to be similar to that of colonic adenomas with tubular or cerebral crypt openings.
